# PED Strain Mapping

### Abstract
In this work, we developed a method using the precession electron diffraction data to
map the residual elastic strain at the nano-scale. The diffraction pattern of each pixel was
first collected and denoised. Template matching was then applied using the center spot as
the mask to identify the positions of the diffraction disks. Statistics of distances between
the selected diffracted disks enable the user to determine “strain-free” baseline and to
generate strain maps. Strain mapping on an unstrained single crystal sapphire shows the
standard deviation of strain measurement is 0.5%. With this method, we were able to
successfully measure and map the residual elastic in VO 2 on sapphire and martensite in a
Ni 50.3 Ti 29.7 Hf 20 shape memory alloy. This approach does not require the user to select a
strain-free area as a reference and can work on datasets even the crystals oriented away
from zone axes. This method is expected to provide a robust way to study the residual
strain of various material systems that complements the existing algorithms for strain
mapping.
